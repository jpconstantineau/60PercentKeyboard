# 60PercentKeyboard
Designing a Custom 60% Keyboard


Focus of this project is to documents the steps and decisions taken while designing my own 60% keyboard.
It will be based on the XD60/XD64 PCB available on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/xd60-xd64-Custom-Mechanical-Keyboard-Kit-up-tp-64-keys-Supports-TKG-TOOLS-Underglow-RGB-PCB/32814945677.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.265.hD2Zy9) or on [massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/xd60-xd64-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit)

There are a number of decisions to take when designing your own custom 60% Keyboard.
