# Which Switches for my custom keyboard?

## Cherry MX Switches
See [here](http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/) for a good overview.

## Gateron Switches
These are Cherry compatible switches but a bit cheaper than their original counterparts.
- Gateron clear: linear 35g actuation force
- Gateron red: linear 45g actuation force
- Gateron yellow: linear 50g actuation force (65g bottom out)
- Gateron black: linear 50g actuation force (70g bottom out)

- Gateron brown: tactile 45g actuation force

- Gateron blue: tactile click 60g actuation force
- Gateron green: tactile click 80g actuation force

The Blue and Green switches are clicky.  As such, they are noisy and emit a high pitch clicking noise.  Great for typists. Not so great for neighbors in the office.

The linear switches are "quiet" on their own.  However, they can be noisy when typing. It's the bottoming-out portion of the switch stroke that's noisy. If you go light, they are relatively quiet. If you smash the keys as you type, it's going to be loud.
The red switches are the preferred ones by gamers.

Brown switches are in-between the red and the blue.  They are not clicky but have a bump in the key travel so that you feel when the switch was activated.
They are one of the most popular switches around.

## Other brands.
There are other brands but are not as commonly available and generally more expensive.

## 3 or 5 pins

For PCB mounts (no plate), you need 5 pins.  Some of the pins are plastic and dig in the PCB to make the switches mode solidly mounted.

For Plate mounts, you need 3 pins.  You can make a 3 pin switch by cutting the plastic legs of the 5 pin switches.  For plate mounts, it is sometimes recommended to use 5 pins for those larger holes where stabilizers are installed. 

In a nutshell, if you are not sure, get 5 pins and clip them as needed.

# Decisions
- Gateron Brown Switches, 5 pins as my first choice
- Gateron Black Switches, 5 pins as my second choice
