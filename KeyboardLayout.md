# Select Keyboard Layout

- Decide on default layout: ISO or ANSI
[ANSI Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@=~%0A%60&=!%0A1&=%2F@%0A2&=%23%0A3&=$%0A4&=%25%0A5&=%5E%0A6&=%2F&%0A7&=*%0A8&=(%0A9&=)%0A0&=%2F_%0A-&=+%0A%2F=&_w:2%3B&=Backspace%3B&@_w:1.5%3B&=Tab&=Q&=W&=E&=R&=T&=Y&=U&=I&=O&=P&=%7B%0A%5B&=%7D%0A%5D&_w:1.5%3B&=%7C%0A%5C%3B&@_w:1.75%3B&=Caps%20Lock&=A&=S&=D&=F&=G&=H&=J&=K&=L&=%2F:%0A%2F%3B&=%22%0A'&_w:2.25%3B&=Enter%3B&@_w:2.25%3B&=Shift&=Z&=X&=C&=V&=B&=N&=M&=%3C%0A,&=%3E%0A.&=%3F%0A%2F%2F&_w:2.75%3B&=Shift%3B&@_w:1.25%3B&=Ctrl&_w:1.25%3B&=Win&_w:1.25%3B&=Alt&_a:7&w:6.25%3B&=&_a:4&w:1.25%3B&=Alt&_w:1.25%3B&=Win&_w:1.25%3B&=Menu&_w:1.25%3B&=Ctrl)

Since I am in America, the ANSI layout is my starting point.  Next, we need to figure out how I generally use my keyboards as I type for the different applications.

- List all computers you currently use and their keyboard layouts
- List all software you use and list the keys and shortcuts you commonly use with these applications
- Observe how you "type" and use modifier keys.

## Chromebook
- Chromebooks don't have a "shift lock" key.  I don't miss it. It's been reused to be a "search" action
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc", media keys and power button.
- ALT-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well.

### Pros
- Default keyboard on many small laptop. I don't miss the keypad of desktop keyboards.
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- On a few occasions I have pressed the "search"/"Shift lock" key instead of "Shift" this starts the search app.  A bit disturbing when typing/coding but it does not occur too often.

## Logitech K400+
- This is a wireless keyboard with mousepad.
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc" media keys and "ins" and "del". A FN key change the action of this top row into a f1-f12 set of keys.  
- FN-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well.
- FN-LEFT/RIGHT is Home/End. 

### Pros
- Small wireless keyboard
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- F1-F12 are not directly activated but as a modifier of the media action keys. I have pressed numerous times the "Search" functionality when trying to press "f5" (reload on explorer). This is more disturbing than the search of the chromebook.

## Chrome/Youtube
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, esc, PgUp, PgDn,

## MsExcel
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn, End, Home, number keys, =+-*/
- Useful keys: ~ (used to see the equations)
- Lots of mouse actions

## MsWord
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn, F9, ALT-F9

## MsPowerpoint
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn, F9, ALT-F9. 
- Lots of mouse actions

## MsOutlook
- Lots of mouse actions

## Games: none
- I am not a gamer. WASD arrow keys don't mean anything to me.

## Operating Systems - Useful console keys:
- Linux: /|"'.* ALT-F1 (tty selection)
- Window: \:"'.*

## Programming
- HTML/Javascript: "'<>
 
## Commonly used tools (startup macros)
- calculator
- notepad
- screenshot tool
