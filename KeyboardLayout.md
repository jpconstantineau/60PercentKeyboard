# Design Keyboard Layout

- List all computers you currently use and their keyboard layouts
- List all software you use and list the keys and shortcuts you commonly use with these applications
- Observe how you "type" and use modifier keys.

## Chromebook
- Chromebooks don't have a "shift lock" key.  I don't miss it. It's been reused to be a "search" action
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc", media keys and power button.
- ALT-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well.

### Pros
- Default keyboard on laptop
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- on a few occasions I have pressed the "search"/"Shift lock" key instead of "Shift" this starts the search app.  A bit disturbing when typing/coding but it does not occur too often.

## Logitech K400+
- This is a wireless keyboard with mousepad.
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc" media keys and "ins" and "del". A FN key change the action of this top row into a f1-f12 set of keys.  
- FN-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well.
- FN-LEFT/RIGHT is Home/End. 

### Pros
- Small wireless keyboard
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- F1-F12 are not directly activated but as a modifier of the media action keys. I have pressed numerous times the "Search" functionality when trying to press "f5" (reload on explorer)
