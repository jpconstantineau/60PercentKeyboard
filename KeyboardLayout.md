# Select Keyboard Layout

Since I am in America, the ANSI layout is my starting point.  Next, we need to figure out how I generally use my keyboards as I type for the different applications. This will help identify whether I really need a full keyboard or if I can go for a smaller footprint.  Considering that I need space on my desk and am already looking into 60% keyboards, the question is really how small could I go.

Here are the steps I went through:

- List all computers you currently use and their keyboard layouts
- List all software you use and list the keys and shortcuts you commonly use with these applications
- Observe how you "type" and use modifier keys (shift, ctrl, alt).
- Do you use toggable keys (shift lock, scroll lock, num lock)?
- Identify the potential keyboard sizes that would work for you; Alternately, which one you would prefer.

# Computers & Applications

## Chromebook
- Chromebooks don't have a "shift lock" key.  I don't miss it. It's been reused to be a "search" action. Alt-search activates "shift lock". It's there but just hidden.
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc", media keys and power button.
- ALT-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well.

### Pros
- Default keyboard on many small laptop. I don't miss the keypad of desktop keyboards.
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- On a few occasions I have pressed the "search"/"Shift lock" key instead of "Shift" this starts the search app.  A bit disturbing when typing/coding but it does not occur too often.

## Logitech K400+
- This is a wireless keyboard with mousepad.
- Layout is similar to a 60% keyboard with arrow keys
- Additional top rows configured to be "esc" media keys and "ins" and "del". A FN key change the action of this top row into a f1-f12 set of keys.  
- FN-Arrows up/down is page up/down. This works well. But sometimes, I wish I could do page up/down one handed by pressing a key with my index and navigating up/down with my other fingers.
- FN-LEFT/RIGHT is Home/End. 

### Pros
- Small wireless keyboard
- Arrow keys are present
### Cons
- F1-F12 are not directly activated but as a modifier of the media action keys. I have pressed numerous times the "Search" functionality when trying to press "f5" (reload on explorer). This is more disturbing than the search of the chromebook. I wish it was the other way around.

## Chrome/Youtube
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, esc, PgUp, PgDn,

## MsExcel
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn, End, Home, number keys, =+-*/
- Useful keys: ~ (used to see the equations) rarely used though.
- Lots of mouse actions

## MsWord
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn, F9, ALT-F9

## MsPowerpoint
- Commonly used keys: Arrows, PgUp, PgDn 
- Lots of mouse actions

## MsOutlook
- Lots of mouse actions

## Games: none
- I am not a gamer. WASD arrow keys don't mean anything to me.

## Operating Systems - Useful console keys:
- Linux: /|"'.* ALT-F1 (tty selection)
- Window: \:"'.*

## Programming
- HTML/Javascript: "'<>
 
## Commonly used tools (startup macros)
- calculator
- notepad
- screenshot tool

# Keyboard Sizes
## 30% Keyboards
[Gherkin](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8f922931ae43fa0117b6baaf4435a33a): 30 keys ortholinear [info](http://www.40percent.club/2016/11/gherkin.html) [where to get parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/63o5u6/parts_to_complete_your_gherkin_and_some_places_to/)
The Gherkin is a very small keyboard.  Extremely portable but lots of missing keys. These may be available on the different layers, however, I feel that it's too much of a compromise.  Also, sourcing it is a bit more difficult. There are no chinese sources for the pcb.

## 40% Keyboards
40% keyboards let go of the f-keys and the number-keys but have enough modifiers to make sense for most people. 

[JD40](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/f24a1a8ebb924650b10be593fdad8207): 40 keys staggered - single wide spacebar

[Daisy 40](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0e343fb80ee3df4613f80dc25bd56ea2): 42 keys staggered - split wide spacebar

The Daisy 40 is a board available from [KPRepublic](https://kprepublic.aliexpress.com/store/3034003) on Aliexpress or Taobao.
This boards supports the JD40 single wide spacebar layout.  There are two set of printed keycaps available [Grey](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/NPKC-40-Thick-PBT-Gray-Black-Mixed-Cherry-Profile-Keycap-Keyset-For-40-AMJ40-YMD40-Mini/32825976887.html) and

The two printed sets have arrows and split spacebars.

[Planck/JJ40](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/22d41797b393f49b84bc02b6eafc95da): 47/48 keys ortholinear

The JJ40 is a board available from [KPRepublic](https://kprepublic.aliexpress.com/store/3034003) on Aliexpress or Taobao which can be used to build a Planck-type keyboard.  Getting [blank keycaps](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/XDA-blank-keycaps-planck-ace40-xt-Keyset-Blank-Similar-to-DSA-For-MX-Mechanical-Keyboard-Ergo/32824353605.html) is easy but getting a printed set is more limited. A partial set is [available](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/top-printed-dsa-keycap-26-keys-dsa-profile-for-cherry-mx-mechanical/32834422565.html).

## 60% Keyboards
60% keyboards let go of the f-keys and have enough modifiers to make sense for most people. Some even have the arrow keys at the cost of smaller or removed modifiers.   

[GH60 Standard](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8e91b02e29361964fd8ce72464f5b749): 61 keys staggered [info](http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/) 

The GH60 is a standard 60% keyboard with lots of interchangeable components.  It's based on the Poker II or Pok3r boards but it's fully programmable.  There are several kits our there based on the GH60.  The GH60 supports a number of layouts.

[XD64](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/faf77c99388f0c5fbb26)

The XD64 is a GH60 compatible board available from [KPRepublic](https://kprepublic.aliexpress.com/store/3034003) on Aliexpress or Taobao. There are also [massdrops](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/xd60-xd64-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit) of this keyboard if you prefer to deal with a US based company.  The XD64 supports a large number of layouts. To do so, it has 2 different plate designs: 2u and 2.25u left shifts. Getting keycap sets for the 2u layouts will be more difficult (more expensive) since standard board layouts usually use a 2.25u left shift.  Having the option between 2 and 2.25 can make ordering more error-prone (as seen on a past massdrop of this board).  

[XD75](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/fab286f4d0ecc8f655645d3421244cd7)

The XD75 is an ortholinear keyboard available from [KPRepublic](https://kprepublic.aliexpress.com/store/3034003) on Aliexpress or Taobao. There are enough keys to fit a num keypad and all F-keys. 

## 68% Keyboards
68% keyboards came to please people that like the 60% but require the arrow keys.  There are a few designs out there but there isn't really a standard design.   Different manufacturers will have slightly different layouts.  As such, parts such as PCBs, Plates and Cases won't be interchangeable.

## TKL Keyboards
[TLK/87 Keys](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/1bdd2184b15cfed700133f1aeba23f1c)

TKL keyboards are shrunk down versions of the full 104 keys keyboards where the num keypad is removed. There are lots of commercially available keyboards of that size.

## Full 104 Keyboards
[Standard 104 Keys](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/aba2882b21cf6660437c1366ddd1e59f)
These are the standard "desktop" kepboards that come with pretty much every desktop system.  Getting replacement keycaps is generally quite easy since the keys are standard sizes.  Some keyboard manufacturers change a bit the bottom row for a wider or narrower spacebar making a replacement keyset more diffficult to find.  This is the size of keyboard I am trying to replace to get more room on my desk.

A few good layouts:
